# 🤖 **Marker Detection with Robot and Camera Control**

## ✨ **Project Overview**

This project involves detecting **ArUco markers** in a simulated Gazebo environment. It is divided into two parts:  

1. **Robot Control**: The robot is moved within the environment to locate and identify markers.  
2. **Camera Control**: A fixed camera is controled to detect markers within its field of view.  

The implementation combines **robot motion control** and **vision-based marker detection** using ROS and Python.

## 🌟 **Features**

- **ArUco Marker Detection**: Identify marker IDs and positions.  
- **Robot Navigation**: Move the robot to align with markers.  
- **Camera Adjustment**: Control the camera to focus on marker detection.  
- **Image Processing**: Annotate detected markers on the output image.  
- **Gazebo Integration**: Simulate the environment and test functionality.
